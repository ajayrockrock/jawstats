jawstats
========

JAWStats Installation guide can be found at:
http://www.jawstats.com/documentation

You can configure awstats to download CDN data like so:  http://wpstorm.net/2011/01/awstats-amazon-s3-cloudfront/

If you do that, then you can also make "pretty" graphs with jawstats using this fork.

The only thing you really need to modify is the "gc\_aClusterDesc" variable in js/constants.js to have appropriate descriptions.  I included the one that I use for Amazon's cloudfront.

If you have corrections then please submit a pull request.

Thanks.
